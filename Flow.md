## 🌊 **Exmample Friday Night Deploy**

**It's Friday 6 PM. You're about to deploy a critical bug fix to production. Here's what happens across ALL your infrastructure:**

---

### **⏰ 6:00 PM Git Push**

```bash
cd ~/react-frontend
git add src/components/LoginForm.js
git commit -m "CRITICAL: Fix login vulnerability CVE-2024-1234"
git push origin main
```

**🔒 Immediate Security Response (VM-SECURITY):**
```bash
# OSSEC on VM-SECURITY detects the git push:
2024-12-16 18:00:15 [OSSEC] Git commit detected: "Fix login vulnerability"
2024-12-16 18:00:16 [OSSEC] Triggering security event correlation
2024-12-16 18:00:17 [Vault] Rotating deployment secrets as precaution
2024-12-16 18:00:18 [Falco] Monitoring for unusual deployment activity

# VM-SECURITY sends alert to monitoring:
→ Prometheus metric: security_events_total{type="deployment"} +1
→ Elasticsearch log: "Security-aware deployment initiated"
```

---

### **⏰ 6:01 PM - GitHub Actions Pipeline Explosion**

**🤖 GitHub Actions (Running on GitHub's servers):**
